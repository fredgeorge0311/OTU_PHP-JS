### Changes

* Changed the execution model of `replace` hooks to prevent multiple calls of the hooked method, if more than one `replace` hook on the same method exists and all of them call `executeParent()` once
* Changed Symfony version to 3.4.11
* Changed jQuery version to 3.3.1
* Changed Slugify version to 3.1
* Changed the event `Shopware_Form_Builder` so that the `reference` contains the `BlockPrefix` of the Formtype, not the name
* Changed REST API `articles` list call to include `mainDetail`
* Changed `themes/Frontend/Bare/frontend/checkout/cart_item.tpl` in which the following blocks are contained:
    * `frontend_checkout_cart_item_product`
    * `frontend_checkout_cart_item_premium_product`
    * `frontend_checkout_cart_item_voucher`
    * `frontend_checkout_cart_item_rebate`
    * `frontend_checkout_cart_item_surcharge_discount`
    All these blocks are moved to own template files to optimize include process. Please be aware that these changes make it necessary to change templates that extend `cart_item.tpl`.
* Changed `themes/Frontend/Bare/frontend/checkout/confirm_item.tpl` and `finish_item.tpl` to keep track of the earlier mentioned changes and additions to `cart_item.tpl` and to use Smarty Inheritance system correctly.
    Please check your templates when you extend `cart_item.tpl`. You now have to extend one of the added subtemplates.
* Changed `country_id` to `countryId` and `state_id` to `stateId` in `Shopware.apps.Customer.model.Address`
* Changed xml files in `engine/Library/Zend/Locale/Data` to be more up-to-date
* Changed rebates and vouchers to also show their icon in the cart for values >1 â‚¬
* Changed basic settings option `Extended SQL query`, so users now need the `sql_rule` permission of `shipping` to edit it.
* Changed `s_order_documents` column `ID` to `id`
* Changed following classes constructor to accept `IteratorAggregate` instead `array` for `tagged` services collections:
    * `Shopware\Bundle\AttributeBundle\Repository\Registry`
    * `Shopware\Bundle\CustomerSearchBundleDBAL\HandlerRegistry`
    * `Shopware\Bundle\EmotionBundle\Service\EmotionElementService`

### Elasticsearch in backend

To activate elasticsearch in backend you have to enable the `es => backend => enabled` parameter in the `config.php` and start a indexation
of the backend entities with `sw:es:backend:index:populate`.
